Whether you’re looking for career training or plan to start your college education at RVCC and then finish at a four-year university, we have a program for you. You can choose from over 90 degree and certificate programs. If you’re looking for a more rigorous and challenging curriculum, we offer an Honors College. If you already have an associate degree, consider taking advanced courses at our University Center – a partnership with leading New Jersey colleges and universities.
